# tvTourney
## A interactive and customizable fantasy-football-style app where users choose the rules for their favorite tv shows.

Possible improvements:
* Comprehensive data / input validation: inputs should be validated on the client, on the server (in the route handlers), and in the database (specifying unique columns and which columns are allowed to be null etc)
* Production grade authentication / encryption - Passwords are currently stored in plain text
* Oath and ability to invite friends by email - even if they don't have an account
* Angular animations / general styling improvements
* Chatroom for users in a league together
* Alternative playing modes - There are a lot of opportunities to get creative here
* Mobile app - Ionic
* Sound effects
* Tv Show presets - For example, you select the bachelor and characters / events are automatically loaded in. Also, would be cool if you could upload CSV's of characters / events
* Refactor tests and route handlers - split them up into logical / functional groupings
* Play with / earn virtual money
* Ability to leave a league
* Test to show that when an event is triggered on a character the score of that character in the roster table is updated - this functionality is working, but there is no test for it yet
